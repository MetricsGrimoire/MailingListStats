Mailing List Stats [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MetricsGrimoire/MailingListStats.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MetricsGrimoire/MailingListStats)
==================

Description
-----------
Mailing List Stats (`mlstats`) is a tool to parse and analyze mail boxes.
It is useful to retrieve and analyze mailing list archives.  The parsed
mail boxes are stored in a database.

`mlstats` is able to retrieve mailing lists from the web,
and store the data of every email in a database, from where to obtain
different kind of reports.

Download

Releases:

* [https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/MailingListStats/releases](https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/MailingListStats/releases)

Latest version:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/MailingListStats.git
```

Requirements
-------------
`mlstats` requires "[SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SQLAlchemy)"
to work with multiple database engines.  `mlstats` has been tested against
Sqlite3, MySQL and PostgreSQL.

To work with MySQL or PostgreSQL, `mlstats` needs the following extra
dependencies:

  * MySQL:
    * Python package "[MySQL-python](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/)"
    * MySQL-Server
  * PostgreSQL:
    * Python package "[psycopg2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psycopg2)"
    * PostgreSQL-Server (tested with 8.4 and 9.x series)


Installation
------------
You can install `mlstats` running setup.py script:

```
$ python setup.py install
```

`mlstats` can be installed without privileges, use the `--prefix` option
to indicate the directory where `mlstats` will be installed. For more
details, take a look at the help of the installer:

```
$ python setup.py install --help
```

You are ready to use `mlstats`.

Running MLStats
---------------

In general configuration is applied by command line arguments or environment variables.
Checkout existing arguments and environment variables via `mlstats --help`.

### Basic Setup Using Sqlite

To run `mlstats` without the hassle of setting a database, you can use
the builtin Sqlite3.

```
$ mlstats --db-engine=slqlite --db-name=MLS-DATA.DB http://URL-OF-YOUR-LIST/
```

Just replace the text in ALL CAPS with your database name, and mailing list
URL to work on.

In this example, if the file `MLS-DATA.DB` does not exists, `mlstats` will
create it for you.

### Using MLStats with MySQL

You are required to have MySQL installed and running in a computer.
Please, refer to the manual of your distribution (if you are using Linux)
or MySQL (if you are running other operating system) to install it,
checking the database is running, and handling the database.

The MySQL backend requires the database already exists. Use the following
command to create the database. The tables will be automatically created 
when mlstats runs.

```sql
mysql> create database mlstats;
```

Assuming you have a MySQL database running on localhost, you might run
mlstats with these commonly used options (replace the text in ALL CAPS
with your database username, database password and mailing list URL):

```
$ mlstats --db-engine=mysql --db-user=USERNAME --db-password=PASS http://URL-OF-YOUR-LIST
```

#### MySQL Tweaks

You may want to increase your `max_allowed_packet`: 1 or 16 MB may be
too low (depends on your mailinglist). It has been reported that 50 MB
might be a good value. To set this at runtime, use
`SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=16*1024*1024;` on the mysql prompt.

### Using MLStats with Postgres

The postgres backend requires the database already exists. The creation
of tables must be done manually. There is a SQL script with the schema
in `db/data_model_pg.sql` that can be used for this purpose.

Assuming you have a PostgreSQL database running on localhost, you might run
mlstats with these commonly used options (replace the text in ALL CAPS
with your database username, database password and mailing list URL):


```
$ mlstats --db-engine=postgres --db-user=USERNAME --db-password=PASS http://URLOFYOURLIST
```

### Other MLStats Options

If you have a different configuration or need more options, more detailed
information about the options, can be learnt by running `mlstats --help`.


Analysis
--------

Analysis of mlstats data is completed by writing database queries. mlstats does the hard
work of parsing the mailing list archives and storing all of this data into a database 
that can be used to extract meaningful data about a mailing list. Because what is meaningful
varies by project, the flexibility of being able to write any query is a necessity.

While this does require a bit of knowledge about database queries, there are a few resources
to help you get started.

* Use the **[Database Schema](https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/MailingListStats/wiki/Database-Schema)**
wiki page to learn more about the database structure. This will help you write your queries, but 
it also gives you a comprehensive list of everything that can be found in the database and 
retrieved in your queries.
* Because we don't want you to start from zero, use the **[Queries](https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/MailingListStats/wiki/Queries)**
wiki page to find some commonly used queries and examples. If you have some interesting examples,
please add them to the wiki page.


Improving MailingListStats
---------------------------

Source code, wiki and submission of bug reports are accessible in [GitHub].

If you want to receive updates about new versions, and keep in touch
with the development team, consider subscribing to the [MetricsGrimoire mailing list][1].
It is a very low traffic list, usually with less than one message per day.

Contributing
------------

When making contributions, please follow the [PEP8 specification][2].
To check your code follows the specification, use a tool like
[pep8][3] or [flake8][4].

When adding new features, add tests for the new feature or fix, and check
that the existing tests pass.  Tests live in `pymlstats/tests` and you can
run them with:

```bash
$ python -m unittest discover
```

Please, also consider to add tests for the current features available.

`mlstats` has been originally developed by the GSyC/LibreSoft group at
the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Mostoles, near Madrid (Spain). It is
part of a wider research on libre software engineering, aimed to gain
knowledge on how libre software is developed and maintained.
